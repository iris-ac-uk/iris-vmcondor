VMCondor allows users to submit HTCondor batch jobs to a pool of virtual 
machines managed by Vcycle/OpenStack or Vac at IRIS sites. The provided
setup script automatically assigns a VMCondor username and creates a VMCondor
key for connecting to the VMCondor server. There is no need for a user
to request an X.509 certificate or run HTCondor daemons.

This repository contains the following directories:

- client, with the script users need to install on their client machines
- server, with files for the prototype VMCondor server operated by IRIS
- vmcondor-ca, with a script to generate certificates VMCondor uses internally
- vm, with files to define the VMCondor virtual machines which run jobs
