VMCondor allows users to submit HTCondor batch jobs to a pool of virtual 
machines managed by Vcycle/OpenStack or Vac at IRIS sites. The provided
setup script automatically assigns a VMCondor username and creates a key
for connecting to the VMCondor server. There is no need for a user
to request an X.509 certificate or run HTCondor daemons.

See the Users' and Sites' Guides in the Wiki for explanations of how to submit
jobs to VMCondor and how sites can provide capacity to the pool:

This repository contains the following directories:

- client, with the script users need to install on their client machines
- server, with files for the prototype VMCondor server operated by IRIS
- vmcondor-ca, with a script to generate certificates VMCondor uses internally
- vm, with files to define the VMCondor virtual machines which run jobs
