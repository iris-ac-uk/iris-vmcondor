VMCondor allows users to submit HTCondor batch jobs to a pool of virtual 
machines managed by Vcycle/OpenStack or Vac at IRIS sites. Users are 
automatically assigned VMCondor usernames and VMCondor key is created to
allow authentication to the VMCondor server. There is no need for users
to interact with X.509 certificates or run HTCondor daemons.

This repository contais the following directories:

- server, with files for the prototype VMCondor server operated by IRIS
- client, with the script users need to install on their client machines
- ca, with a script to generate certificates VMCondor uses internally
- vm, with files to define the VMCondor virtual machines which run jobs
