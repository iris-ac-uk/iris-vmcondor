To build: clone this repo and then execute

make push

------

To create a container from the image, it is recommended to mount a volume
at /home/user with the files you write. This should make it easier to move
to newer versions of the image whilst retaining your own files.

On Linux or macOS, a command like this may be used to create and enter
an iris-vmcondor Docker container as a non-privileged user:

docker run --user user --tty --interactive \
  --volume $HOME/iris-vmcondor-home:/home/user \
  --workdir /home/user irisacuk/iris-vmcondor:latest /bin/bash --login

The editors emacs, nano, joe, and vi are also available.
