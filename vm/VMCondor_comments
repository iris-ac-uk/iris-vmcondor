# VMCondor: generic Cloud Init user_data template file for use with Vacuum
# based systems (Vac,Vcycle), and containing the following 
# ##user_data___## substitutions:
#   ##user_data_option_cvmfs_proxy##
#   ##user_data_space##
# Each substitution pattern may occur more than once in this template. If
# you are reading a processed file, then these substitutions will already
# have been made below. 
# This file should normally be processed by Vac (version 0.20.0 onwards) or
# Vcycle (0.3.0 onwards) internally.
