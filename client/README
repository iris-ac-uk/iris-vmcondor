vmcondor_setup script to be installed on VMCondor users' machines.

vmcondor_setup depends on the openssl, curl and condor_* commands being
available on the Unix $PATH. No system level configuration of HTCondor
in /etc/condor is needed, and the HTCondor daemons should not be started.

vmcondor_setup should be placed on the $PATH in a directory writeable by
the user (eg $HOME/bin). When first run, vmcondor_setup will create a
vmcondor.key file in $HOME/.vmcondor and invite the user to get their
VMCondor username approved by the operators of the VMCondor service.
The vmcondor_setup command will also create symbolic links to the various
VMCondor user commands (vmcondor_version vmcondor_submit vmcondor_q 
vmcondor_status vmcondor_transfer_data) and populate $HOME/.vmcondor
will other required configuration files.

more detailed instructions.
