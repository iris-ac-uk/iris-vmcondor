This directory contains

1) vmcondor_setup script to be installed on VMCondor users' machines
2) Makefile etc for packaging the script


vmcondor_setup depends on the openssl, curl and condor_* commands being
available on the Unix $PATH. No system level configuration of HTCondor
in /etc/condor is needed, and the HTCondor daemons should not be started.

See https://github.com/iris-ac-uk/iris-vmcondor/wiki/Users-Guide for
more detailed instructions.

1) Manual install

vmcondor_setup should be placed on the $PATH in a directory writeable by
the user (eg $HOME/bin). When first run, vmcondor_setup will create a
vmcondor.key file in $HOME/.vmcondor and invite the user to get their
VMCondor username approved by the operators of the VMCondor service.
The vmcondor_setup command will also create symbolic links to the various
VMCondor user commands (vmcondor_version vmcondor_submit vmcondor_q 
vmcondor_status vmcondor_transfer_data) and populate $HOME/.vmcondor
will other required configuration files.

2) RPM install

The vmcondor-client RPM can be used to install vmcondor_setup . The
files example.sub and example.sh mentioned in the Users Guide are 
installed in /usr/lib/vmcondor-client/

3) Docker install

The iris-vmcondor Docker image includes vmcondor_setup in 
/usr/local/bin and VMCondor's dependencies: HTCondor, OpenSSL, Curl.

To build the image to allow local testing: clone the repo and then 
execute:

make docker-build

To push the image into Docker Hub and make it the latests verison, 
execute:

make docker-push

When creating a container from the image, it is recommended that users
mount a directory from their $HOME directory on the host as /home/user
within the container. This can contain the files they write. This should
make it easier to move to newer versions of the image whilst retaining
their own files.

On Linux or macOS, a command like this may be used to create and enter
an iris-vmcondor Docker container as a non-privileged user:

mkdir -p $HOME/iris-vmcondor-home
docker run \
  --volume $HOME/iris-vmcondor-home:/home/user \
  --tty --interactive \
  irisacuk/iris-vmcondor:latest

The editors emacs, nano, joe, and vi are also installed.
