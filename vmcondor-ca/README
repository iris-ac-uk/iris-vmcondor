Files for creating the private certificate authority cert and key for VMCondor.

The files VMCondorCA00.pem and VMCondorCA00key.pem are produced which
must be installed in various places:

- Both files on the VMCondor server in /etc/grid-security for 
  vmcondor-ca-cgi to use
- VMCondorCA00.pem and VMCondorCA00.signing_policy in 
  /etc/grid-security/certificates for the GSI subsystem of the HTCondor
  server to use
- Symbolic links XXXXXXX.0 and XXXXXXX.signing_policy must also be created in 
  /etc/grid-security/certificates where XXXXXXX is from
  openssl x509 -in VMCondorCA00.pem -noout -hash
- ./client/vmcondor_setup in this repository must be modified to create
  VMCondorCA00.pem and hash in $HOME/.vmcondor/certificates
